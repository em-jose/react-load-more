# React Load More

## Overview

Application created for the sole purpose of practicing different technologies and techniques in React. My goals with this application are the following:

* To practice fetching to an API.
* Implement a loading system 
* To implement an infinite scroll system.
* Test [Shadcn-UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
* Test [Animate.css](https://animate.style/)

The API that I have used to create the application has been https://dummyjson.com/
